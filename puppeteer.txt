What can I do?
Most things that you can do manually in the browser can be done using Puppeteer! Here are a few examples to get you started:

Generate screenshots and PDFs of pages.
Automate form submission, UI testing, keyboard input, etc.


Installation
To use Puppeteer in your project, run:

npm i puppeteer



Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or 
Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.



To sum it up, Puppeteer is faster than Selenium, but it works only with Chrome, while Selenium works with Chrome, Firefox, Safari,
 Internet Explorer and Edge.Jul 15, 2019
